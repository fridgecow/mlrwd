Each line is a space-seperate key=value pair. 
- The 'word' key refers to which word is being described
- The 'intensity' key refers to how strong the judgement by that word is. For example, 'sputter' is strongly negative while 'foul' is weakly negative, in this database.
- The 'polarity' key records the sentiment of the word (positive, negative)

Some words that seem useful based on REVIEWS[1-4], and my judgements for how important they are:
1. recommend - weak positive
2. bland - weak negative
3. nice - weak positive
4. forgotten - strong negative
5. butt-jokes - strong negative
6. relax - strong positive
7. popcorn - weak positive
8. classic - weak positive
9. wonder - weak positive
10. motivations - weak positive

A comparison with the provided lexicon:
1. Strong positive in lexicon - this isn't surprising.
2. Strong negative in lexicon - again, not surprising. My judgement is probably naive given I have only classified 10 words while they have classified ~6,500
3. Strong positive - not at all surprising.
4. Does not appear - this is surprising. Given the context, forgotten will likely often mean that the film does not feature some critical component. Therefore, I'd expect the appearance of the word to be a strong negative indicator.
5. Does not appear - it appears in review 3, and is used to quite strongly discredit the film. However, it's not surprising.
6. Weak positive - I would have expected this to be stronger, but am not surprised about the classification.
7. Does not appear - while the word could be interpreted neutrally, I think it will often be applied as it was in our example reviews, in association with 'sit back and relax'.
8. Weak positive - finally, I got one right!
9. Strong positive - in hindsight, this is what I should have put too.
10. "motivation" is strong positive, again, not surprising.
